# MainLibraryBusyBot
An unofficial Telegram bot to check how busy the University of Edinburgh's Main Library is. [Check it out!](https://t.me/MainLibraryBusyBot)

## Install
```bash
npm install --save node-telegram-bot-api
```

## Usage
```bash
node busy.js
```

## Caveats
I'm relying here on the weird JSON file hosted by the university, which entails a certain amount of bloat to fetch the data I want.

## Credits
